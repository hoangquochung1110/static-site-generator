# What is WSGI
is a specification that defines standard interface between Web Server and Python web application or framework.

# What is WSGI for ?
- Universal Communication: It enables Python web applications to communicate with web servers in a standardized way, ensuring compatibility across different servers and frameworks.
- Server Independence: Developers can write web applications without worrying about which web server will eventually host them. The same application can run on Apache, Nginx with uWSGI, Gunicorn, or any other WSGI-compliant server.
- Framework Flexibility: WSGI makes it possible to switch between different Python web frameworks (like Django, Flask, or Pyramid) without changing the server configuration.
