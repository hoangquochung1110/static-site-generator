- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m HoÃ ng Quá»‘c HÆ°ng
- ðŸŒ± Besides strong desires in learning up-to-date technologies like Django or React, as a Web developer, I keen on learning how to make a reliable and maintainable software system with high scalability. I'm convinced that such these factors make a good application rather than those technologies.
- ðŸ“œ I start writing [blogs](https://dev.to/hoangquochung1110) as well.

### Work Experience Summary

- I've been in web development since my graduation. I worked as a backend developer for over half a year before I joined the compulsory **military service for 2 years** and I'm now ready to get back to work in February 2022. 
- During my previous role as a Python at Omni Apps, I took part in two main projects of the company: a timekeeping app and multi-class booking management system. These two require complex authorization and permission while I got involved in many stages of the project development: planning, implementation and testing.
- For the last half of this year, I've fortunately had access to my computer occasionally while serving in the military. I took this wonderful opportunity to revise and strengthen my knowledge in web development so that I could to some extent get caught up with what's going on out there. I picked up JavaScript as well as familiarized myself with ReactJS which I lacked in my first full-time job leading to my limited understanding on what a frontend developer does. The other two problems that I went deeper into were system scaling and performance optimization techniques. Such knowledge of mine is just on paper therefore I'm now eager to turn it into practice.

### Mindset
- In the early stage of my career, I would like to get involved as much as possible, play several roles in the process of a product development so that I can have a broad and overall picture on how a software development lifecycle works. This way makes me grow fast and I can contribute greater value back to my organization.
- Willing to take on challenges. 
- Everyone always has a lesson for me learn.
- Asking smart questions to improve product on daily basis.
