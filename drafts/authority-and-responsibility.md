# Authority & Responsibility

> **Authority**: the right and obligation to make decisions and take action in a given scope

> **Responsibility**: the obligation to accept consequences, good and bad

### Thought Experiment

Staying on a motorcycle for the moment, let’s say I ask you to take my bike to the pizza place to pick us up some deep dish. I’m in a hurry, though, so while you can steer, I’m going to control the accelerator from here on the couch. How do you feel about this arrangement?

Okay, little tweak. I’m still going to control the throttle, but I’m going to ride the bike with you. Feel different? Now you get to control both steering and throttle. Different?

### Two Principles

The problem comes because people are people. We are all subject to loss aversion (where losing $1 feels worse than gaining $1 feels good [ed: see also ergodicity for more perspective]). We are all tempted to free ride (let others do the work while accruing the benefit ourselves). At the same, we all want to be significant, to do important work and be recognized for it.

Two organizational principles reduce the chaos caused by our natural human tendencies:

Responsibility aligns with authority. If I have the authority to make a decision, then I experience the consequences of that decision.
Responsibility comes as a package. If I get the benefits of a good outcome, I also feel the pain of a bad outcome.
