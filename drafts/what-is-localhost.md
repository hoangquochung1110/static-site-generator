### loopback address

every host has this loopback interface built into it and all of them have the same IP address set on it - 127.0.0.1

When you're talking about 127.0.0.1, it's like referring to yourself. It's like saying: "I, me, or myself". Anything you send to IP 127.0.0.1 is sent to the same host, nothing leaves the host system.

you can not access web server from other host other than this host

you can say localhost because localhost is the standard network name associated with the loopback ip address.
