## Honest observations on monthly expenses in Canada as well as Software Engineer Salaries and the balance between them.



> This video is spot on. I'm a junior developer in Toronto and affordability in this city, but also the rest of Southern Ontario, is horrendous. Despite having a wage which is higher than the junior developer wage-band in this video, I cannot afford to rent in Toronto, Waterloo, or really anywhere in Southern Ontario because if I did I'd have to throw away over 50% of my take home income into the rent pit alone. After normal living expenses, forget saving anything because you'll be left with a couple bucks if that.

>These arguments I hear from people like "oh just move somewhere cheaper" or "settle for less" are fucking stupid because moving somewhere cheaper usually means, like you said in your video, a big pay cut, which after taking into account housing prices still means you're either in the same boat as the more expensive city, or worse off. Young people in Canada just can't settle for less anymore because the "less" is still too damn expensive.

>I agree with your opinion on the Canadian immigration system, it is a big scam to get highly educated smart people from all over the world to work for shit wages. If anyone reading this comment is considering moving to Canada I'd suggest otherwise. I was born here and even I'm struggling, I can't imagine how bad it would be for a new resident who has no family or social support in the country already.

>For fucks sake I went to school for 4 years, in a field that is in demand, I did everything right and our society still fucked me over.
