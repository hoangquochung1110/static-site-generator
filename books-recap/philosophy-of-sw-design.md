### 1. Introduction

### 2. The Nature of Complexity
Complexity defined: anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it hard to understand and modify the system. You can also think of complexity in terms of cost and benefit. In a complex system, it takes a lot of work to implement even small improvements. In simple systems, larger improvements can be implemented with less effort.

Complexity is more apparent to readers to writers. If you write a piece of code and it seems simple to you but other people think it's complex then it is complex.

3. Working Code Isn't Enough
4. Modules Should Be Deep
5. Information Hiding
6. General-Purpose Modules Are Deeper
7. Different Layers, Different Abstractions
8. Pull Complexity Downwards
9. Better Together or Better Apart
10. Consistency
11. Code Should Be Obvious
