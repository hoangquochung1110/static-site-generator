explain why this approach below might not work:

```
await this.page.click("#login-submit"), // Submit form
await this.page.waitForNavigation({ waitUntil: 'networkidle0' }), // Wait for navigation to complete
```

The issue with that code is due to how the `await` statements are being used. Let me explain why it's problematic:

1. When you separate the operations with commas and await them individually like this:
```javascript
await this.page.click("#login-submit"),
await this.page.waitForNavigation({ waitUntil: 'networkidle0' }),
```

The operations happen sequentially rather than in parallel. Here's what actually occurs:

1. First, it waits for the click to complete
2. THEN it starts waiting for navigation

This creates a race condition because:
- By the time your code starts waiting for navigation, the navigation might have already started and possibly even finished
- The `waitForNavigation` call might miss the navigation event entirely since it started listening too late
- This can lead to timeouts or hanging

This is why we use `Promise.all()` instead:
```javascript
await Promise.all([
  page.waitForNavigation({ waitUntil: 'networkidle0' }),
  page.click("#login-submit")
]);
```

With `Promise.all()`:
1. The navigation listener is set up first
2. The click is triggered second
3. Both promises are waited for simultaneously
4. No navigation events can be missed because the listener is already active before the click occurs

Think of it like trying to catch a ball - you need to have your hands ready (navigation listener) before someone throws it (form submission), not try to get your hands ready after they've already thrown it!
