# API Gateway Authorization Methods: My quick evaluation

## Intro
I'm developing a utility tool for my internal team using API Gateway + Lambda. One aspect I'd like to apply when it comes to securing APIs is limiting API access. AWS provides us three primary authorization methods exist: IAM, Amazon Cognito, and Lambda Authorizers. Here is my quick evaluation of each method's implementation effort, and ideal use cases.

## Authorization Method Comparisons

### 1. IAM Authorization
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Best For**: Internal AWS environments
- **Implementation Effort**: 1/5
- **Key Advantages**:
  - Native AWS ecosystem integration
  - Minimal custom code requirements
- **Limitations**:
  - Restricted to AWS infrastructure
  - Limited external user support

### 2. Amazon Cognito
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Best For**: User-centric applications
- **Implementation Effort**: 3/5
- **Key Advantages**:
  - Managed user authentication
  - Built-in social login capabilities
  - Multi-factor authentication support
- **Challenges**:
  - Requires initial configuration
  - Steeper learning curve for advanced features

### 3. Lambda Authorizers
- **Complexity**: High
- **Best For**: Enterprise-level, custom authentication scenarios
- **Implementation Effort**: 5/5
- **Key Advantages**:
  - Maximum authentication customization
  - Supports intricate authentication logic
  - Integrates with external identity providers
- **Challenges**:
  - Requires custom Lambda function development
  - Higher maintenance overhead
  - Potential performance implications

## Recommendation Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended Method |
|----------|-------------------|
| Small/Internal Projects | IAM |
| User-Focused Applications | Cognito |
| Complex Enterprise Requirements | Lambda Authorizers |

## My closing thoughts
I'm developing some web-bases utility tools for my internal team. IAM Authorization seems a no-brainer to me. Minimal coding and configuration required helps me to ship fast to collect users' feedback as we also use AWS as our cloud provider.

In case, security concerns and authorization grow more complex, I'll look into Lambda Authorizers thanks to its flexibility while I'd like to avoid AWS Cognito as it requires steep learning curve when requirements are more complex.
