When you use git, one of the most frequent used command is

```bash
git commit -m "my commit message"
```

But most of the time, you would give a more meaningful commit message. Meaningful I mean here is that the message should consist of subject line (a short description of your changes in code) and body (to give more detailed description of what you did)

Today I learn that `git commit` accept multiple message flag ðŸ˜‰
If you run this command
```bash
git commit -m "subject line" -m "commit description"
```

It will result in this
```bash

    Subject line
    
    Commit message
```

This new finding helps me save time a lot. No need to open a vim editor when committing message with subject and body. And actually [the git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt--mltmsggt) do mention it.

Bonus: Another way to achieve this commit message structure is opening quotes then press enter and closing the commit with quotes again
